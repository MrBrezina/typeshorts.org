### About TypeShorts ###

*TypeShorts is an evening full of short type presentations taking place in a relaxed atmosphere of a café/bar/pub/gallery (not unlike Pecha Kucha, but without its formal constraints and with drinks) by students, designers, teachers, researchers; essentially anyone who wishes to share their passion for type and graphic design is welcome. Each presentation takes 321 seconds. Presentations can be in English, Slovak, or Czech language and can take any kind of form from self-promotional to educational, from speech to movie screening. The goal is to provide as democratic a stage as possible, therefore there is minimal curatorship.*
